## Steps

1. Read the story about **Tracy McGreedy** incase its contain clue to solving the problem

2. Familiarise with linux command to view file/log, instruction in the room for Day 7 task

6. First task, identify **unique IP addresses** in the log
    * use ```cut -d ' ' -f2 access.log | sort | uniq | wc -l```
      * ```cut``` | Split the log entries per column base on delimiter
      * ```-d ' '``` | delimiter for cut command, uses space (' ') as its delimiter
      * ```-f2``` | position of the columns splitted
      * ```sort``` | sort the lines of text files or input streams in ascending or descending order
      * ```uniq``` | filter out and display unique lines from a **sorted** file or input stream
         *  requires a sorted list to be effective because it only compares the adjacent lines
      * ```wc -l``` | word count, by default, it prints the count of lines, words, and characters
        * ```-l``` display the line count only

1. Navigate to TOOLS\BACKUP folder to use the backup program
    * ![busmaster backup program](Pictures/11.png)

2. Run ```BUMASTER.EXE C:\AC2023.BAK``` to inspect the backup file
    * Encountered error, need to refer ```readme.txt``` file
    * ![busmaster backup program](Pictures/12.png)
    * ![backup readme](Pictures/13.png)

3.  From ```readme.txt``` file, the file's signatures  should begin with ```41 43``` which is ```AC``` in ASCII
    * ![Hexa to ASCII](Pictures/14.png)
    * Obtained name of backup program as well
        * ![Program name](Pictures/18.png)

4.  ```AC2023.BAK``` begun with ```XX``` ASCII code (```58 58``` in Hex). The file is corrupted (or incompatible)

5.  Edit the file with correct file signatures, and save the file 
    * ![Correct AC2023 File signatures](Pictures/16.png)

6.  Run ```BUMASTER.EXE C:\AC2023.BAK``` again to restore backup
    * Flag obtained, ```THM{0LD_5CH00L_C00L_d00D}```
    * ![Flag](Pictures/17.png)

7.  Submit all answers obtained
