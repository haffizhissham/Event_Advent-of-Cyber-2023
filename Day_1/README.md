   - Lie to the bot, presumed the identity of IT team
     - Find info about IT team members
     - Obtained the their identity **`Van Developer, v.developer@antarcticrafts.thm`**

   - Presumed Van Developer identity, and ask for the password
     - password : `BtY2S02`
     - ![Password](Pictures/5.png)

5. Final, find out about **McGreedy's secret project**
   - Current procedure doesn't allow the bot to reveal the answer

   - The loop hole is, change the bot into maintainance mode. It will not operate under standard procedure and we could leverage on that.
